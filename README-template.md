## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Because I am still a newbie and still in school, I always get idle in learning more in web development or get stuck in html and css only. But with some help of youtube videos and a solution from iamcerebrocerberus, I viewed his source code and it helped me some to make this design responsive, thanks to him. I got confused and frustrated in getting the product card to be responsive using grid and flexbox. Lesson learned that when I get frustated, just relax and think again or get up and do some stretching.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=59s) - This helped me for to understand grid layout quickly. I may use his teaching of grid because it is really easy to understand.
